# 🧱 Student Project – Local Network Blockchain Demonstration

The assigned study project is: The impact of blockchain in finance, electronic voting, and traceability.
This is part of our final year project. It aims to concretely illustrate the functioning of a private blockchain through the deployment of nodes on a simulated local network with two PCs, two routers, and two switches. A **smart contract** was also developed and deployed to show the possible interaction between the nodes.

Two local networks are connected via a single router. Each PC hosts a full blockchain node and communicates peer-to-peer through the network interfaces.
